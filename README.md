# MY ERLANG DRAFTS

I am reading [_Learn You Some Erlang for Greater Good_](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) and taking a few notes on the syntax, just to get used to it.

**This repo doesn't contain code supposed to be optimal (or even good).**

In case you want, ping me at twitter: [@vquaiato](http://twitter.com/vquaiato)
